So far we have explored harmonic loading (sine or cosine forcing functions). In reality we may need to analyse much more complex dynamic loading. However, as you will see in this section we can make use of what we've already learned to achieve this.\n",

We don't have time to explore those here, but they generally require the use of superposition (see Duhamel Integral method and Fourier decomposition). As such, they are not applicable in cases where non-linear structural behaviour is expected. \n",

    "A good example of non-linear structural behaviour is the behaviour of structures designed to survive an earthquake. Structures designed to resist collapse in the event of an earthquake are required to exhibit significant nonlinear plastic behaviour. As such, dynamic analysis methods that assume linear structural behaviour are not appropriate.\n",

    "Superposition methods are also not appropriate in cases where feedback exists between the applied load and structural response. One classic example of this is human-structure interaction (HSI). HSI, although rare, can be seen for example on bridges (mainly footbridges) and describes the phenomenon whereby the gait of the occupying crowd is altered in response to bridge motion. If this gait alteration leads to an increase in force magnitude or shift in frequency of force exciting the bridge, a positive feedback loop may be established. The London Millennium footbridge and Clifton Suspension Bridge in Bristol (below) are two such bridges that have exhibited this behaviour."

These are in fact a family of solution methodologies known as step-by-step methods. \n",

In this way the behaviour of the structure is determined step-by-step as the result of a succession of short duration linear analyses. "

This approach offers us maximum flexibility and is a tool well worth knowing how to use.\n",

Again we can demonstrate the effect of varying the time-step by carrying out a sensitivity analysis similar to that above. The figure below shows the variation in dynamic behaviour as the simulation time-step is progressively reduced. We can see that at a certain point the behaviour converges and no further improvement is gained by continuing to reduce the time-step.
